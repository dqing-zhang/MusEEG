This project was made using the Emotiv EPOC+ EEG headset.

![epoc](../img/epoc.png){:height="183px" width="263px"}

Some specs on it:
- number of channels: 14
- sampling rate: 128 or 256 Hz
- resolution 14 bits with 1 LSB = 0.51&mu;V

but you can probably learn more about it from [Emotiv](https://www.emotiv.com/product/emotiv-epoc-14-channel-mobile-eeg/) themselves.

This paper presents a BCMI with the purpose of providing an easy-to-use musical interface for people with motor disabilities. The MusEEG BCMI allows users to trigger MIDI events by performing facial expressions, as well as send continuous band power data for manipulating musical control parameters. By using facial expression recognition and high-level musical objects such as pre-built chords and melodies, MusEEG seeks to provide an inclusive interface that enables users with little musical experience to create musical ideas. Implementing the MusEEG system requires nothing more than a laptop, a software instrument (either through a digital audio workstation, Max/MSP or SuperCollider), and a commercial-grade EEG headset, making it one of the most affordable BCMI systems for inclusive music performance.
